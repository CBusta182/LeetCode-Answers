# LeetCode-Answers

Hi there!

Thank you for looking at my github and finding my leetcode solutions repository.
This repository is just a collection of my solutions to several LeetCode problems.
The goal of this repository is to show you my problem solving and coding skills as well as how I construct my algorithms.
Hopefully this will give you a nice insight of my skills as a Software Developer and what to expect if you were to give me a coding challenge.

In every folder I have listed my solution ( labeled solution ) and a quick README file that contians the LeetCode question.
Note that some questions have multiple solution files. The reason for this is because I like to try and solve the same question in different languages.
The language I use should be the extension of the file. For example if I were to use Javascript for a solution, the file will be labeled `Solution.js`.
